Since graduating with a BSCS from The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, my journey at Crexed has been marked by a blend of front-end flair and back-end rigor. Our team excels in deploying Laravel for robust web solutions, ensuring our projects are both innovative and aligned with the latest industry standards.

My expertise shines in MVC, JWT for authentication, and Pusher / Reverb for WebSocket where I've contributed to secure, scalable REST APIs and intuitive database designs. This skill set, coupled with a deep understanding of client needs, empowers our team to deliver web applications that are not just functional but resonate with users' expectations.
